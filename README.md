KidMart is an e-commerce platform made to help parents and guardians conveniently shop for kids’ and babies’ essentials. The system is designed to work on both web and mobile platforms, making it easier for users to access the store anytime and anywhere.

For the website, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface. The mobile application was built using Flutter and Dart, providing a smooth experience on Android and iOS devices. The backend was developed using Flask and Python, which handles all the core logic and system functionalities. To store and manage user, product, and order data, we used a MySQL database.

This project was developed as part of our coursework for three IT subjects: System Integration and Architecture, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies, and Mobile Computing.
